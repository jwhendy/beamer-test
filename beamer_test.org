* Introduction
** Preface

This is an updated file based on [[https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html][this tutorial]] from Eric S Fraga in an attempt to clarify
org-mode Beamer export in 2022 for [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6691588/emacs-org-beamer-no-definition-for-class-beamer-in-org-export-latex-class/7972859][this StackExchange question]].

Key changes:
- had to change =H:3= to =H:2= in the =#+options= line
- added in the Madrid template
- deleted options lines that didn't seem relevant
- regenerated a screenshot so the image insertion would work
- made a =min-config= for reproducibility; one should =emacs -Q=, then =M-x load-file
  [RET] path/to/min-config= and then try exporting

** Overview
   This presentation provides an illustration of some of the capabilities of the *Beamer* export in =org= mode:

   1. simple slides (this one),
   2. slides with special blocks,
   3. multi-column slides and
   4. the use of *Babel* for literate programming.

   This file should be exported using =M-x org-export-dispatch= (=C-c C-e=), specifying =l= for \LaTeX{} and then =P=, for instance, to generate the PDF.

* Methodology
** A simple slide
This slide consists of some text with a number of bullet points:

- the first, very *important*, point!
- the previous point shows the use of the special markup which
  translates to the Beamer specific /alert/ command for highlighting
  text.
- note: the original worg presentation features =@foo@= notation for the very
  =@important@= point above, which is supposed to convert the text to =\alert{foo}=, but
  isn't happening. I can't find information easily on why and just replaced it with bold text.

The above list could be numbered or any other type of list and may
include sub-lists.

** A more complex slide
This slide illustrates the use of Beamer blocks.  The following text,
with its own headline, is displayed in a block:

*** Org mode increases productivity                               :B_theorem:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_env: theorem
    :END:
    - org mode means not having to remember LaTeX commands.
    - it is based on ascii text which is inherently portable.
    - Emacs!

    \hfill \(\qed\)


** Two columns

*** A block                                           :B_ignoreheading:BMCOL:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :END:
    - this slide consists of two columns
    - the first (left) column has no heading and consists of text
    - the second (right) column has an image and is enclosed in an
      *example* block

*** A screenshot                                            :BMCOL:B_example:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.6
    :BEAMER_env: example
    :END:

** Babel
   :PROPERTIES:
   :BEAMER_envargs: [t]
   :END:
*** Octave code						      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.45
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :END:
#+name: octaveexample
#+begin_src octave :results output :exports both
A = [1 2 ; 3 4]
b = [1; 1];
x = A\b
#+end_src

*** The output						      :BMCOL:B_block:
    :PROPERTIES:
    :BEAMER_col: 0.4
    :BEAMER_env: block
    :BEAMER_envargs: <2->
    :END:

#+results: octaveexample
#+begin_example
A =

   1   2
   3   4

x =

  -1
   1

#+end_example

* Conclusions

** Summary
   - org is an incredible tool for time management
   - *but* it is also excellent for writing and for preparing presentations
   - Beamer is a very powerful \LaTeX{} package for presentations
   - the combination is unbeatable!
